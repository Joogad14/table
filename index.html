        That day marked the beginning of an exciting journey in tech school! I arrived on campus,eager
         to start learning and exploring the world of technology. Here's a quick recap of my first day:
         I attended an orientation session, where i met with faculty members, staff, and fellow students. 
         I learned about the school's history, mission, and expectations. I was introduced to your instructors
         and classmates in my first set of classes. I got a glimpse of what to expect in each course and started
         building connections with my peers.I took a tour of the campus, familiarizing myself with the facilities, 
         labs, and resources available.I setted up your devices, installed necessary software, and got familiar with 
         the school's online platforms. I left with a positive first impression, feeling excited and motivated to dive
         into the world of tech.
